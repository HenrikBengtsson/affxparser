Changes to the Affymetrix Fusion SDK:

From the original zip archive (fusion_source.zip), 
the following have been removed
(. refers to cvs_head/affy/sdk):
the file
  ./fusion_sdk_readme.html
and the following directories, including subdirectories
  ./file_formats
  ./fusion_build
  ./interface_docs
  ./libraries_and_tools
  ./parser_examples
  ./calvin_files/fusion/swig-cs
  ./calvin_files/fusion/swig-java
  ./calvin_files/fusion/swig-perl
 
There have been a number of bugfixes, all of them reported to 
devnet@affymetrix.com. These will likely be included in the next 
release of the SDK.
