- use of atoi()
 in fusion_sdk/calvin_files/fusion/src/CalvinAdapter/CalvinCELDataAdapter.cpp
 requires #include <stdlib.h>

- use of wcstombs and mbstowcs
 in fusion_sdk/calvin_files/utils/src/StringUtils.cpp
 requires #include <stdlib.h>

- use of EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS
 in fusion_sdk/file/BPMAPFileData.cpp
 requires #include <stdlib.h>
