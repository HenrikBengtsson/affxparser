Package: affxparser
===================

Version: 1.3.3 [2006-04-15]
o Updated the Fusion SDK to version 1.0.5 (an unofficial release).
  It now works on Solaris.
o New method readCdfCellIndices(), which is a 5-10 times faster
  special-case implementation of readCdfUnits() to read cell 
  indices only.
o Now readCelUnits() sorts the cell indices before reading the
  data from each file.  This minimizes the amount of jumping around
  in the CEL files resulting in a speed-up of about 5-10 times.
o Renamed readCdfUnitsMap() to readCdfUnitsWriteMap().
o New method invertMap() for fast inversion of maps.
o KNOWN BUGS: The weird bug as in v1.3.2 remains with the new
  Fusion SDK, R v2.3.0 beta (2006-04-10 r37715) on WinXP.
  Internally readCdfCellIndices() replaces readCdfUnits(),
  but the error is still the same.

Version: 1.3.2 [2006-03-28]
o All cell and unit indices are now starting from one and not
  from zero.  This change requires that all code that have
  been using a previous version of this package have to be
  updated!
o Further optimization in speed and memory for most methods.
o New methods readCelRectangle() to read probe signals from a
  specify area of the chip.
o Added extensive help on cell coordinates and cell indices 
  as well read and write maps.
o KNOWN BUGS: At least on WinXP, heavy use of readCelUnits() 
  will sooner or later core dump R; it seems to be a memory 
  related from that occur when reading the CDF and extracting
  the name of the unit.  However, when "torturing" readCdfUnits() 
  the crash won't happen so it might be that readCel() does 
  something.  Have not tried on other platforms.

Version: 1.3.1
