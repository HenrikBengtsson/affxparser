These are the source files from Affymetrix, they are almost completely 
unmodified, save for the CDFFileData.cpp, CDFFileData.h. This modification
is noted in the file and was due to our desire to add support for a different
notion of PM/MM. 

The interesting file is probably R_affx_parser.cpp - which contains the C-R
bridge for all the file types. The _Makefile is there for debugging and might
be better off being removed.
