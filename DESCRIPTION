Description: Package for parsing Affymetrix files (CDF, CEL, CHP, BPMAP, BAR).  It provides methods for fast and memory efficient parsing of Affymetrix files using the Affymetrix' Fusion SDK.  Both ASCII- and binary-based files are supported.  Currently, there are methods for reading chip definition file (CDF) and a cell intensity file (CEL).  These files can be read either in full or in part.  For example, probe signals from a few probesets can be extracted very quickly from a set of CEL files into a convenient list structure.
